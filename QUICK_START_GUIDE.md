## ✅ Step 1: Access Cloudflare Pages Dashboard

1. **Open your browser** and go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. **Log in** with your Cloudflare account (e.g., `kimbersykes87@gmail.com`)
3. **In the left sidebar**, look for and click **"Pages"**
   - If you don't see it, make sure you're logged into the correct account
   - Pages may be under "Workers & Pages" in some layouts

**What you should see:**
- A list of your Pages projects (if any exist)
- Or an empty state with "Create a project" button

**Next:** Tell me what you see, or proceed to Step 2 if you see the Pages dashboard.

## 🔍 Current Status Check

Before we proceed, let me know:

1. **Are you logged into Cloudflare Dashboard?** (Yes/No)
2. **Do you see "Pages" in the left sidebar?** (Yes/No)
3. **Do you already have a Pages project called "Mezcalomano"?** (Yes/No/Not sure)

Based on your answers, I'll guide you through either:
- **Creating a new project** (if none exists)
- **Using an existing project** (if one is already set up)

1. ✅ **Set up Cloudflare Pages project** (connect to your Git repository)
2. ✅ **Configure build settings** (Astro preset, build command, output directory)
3. ✅ **Add your reCAPTCHA keys** as environment variables ⚠️ CRITICAL
4. ✅ **Deploy the site**
5. ✅ **Configure custom domain** (mezcalomano.com)
6. ✅ **Test everything**
