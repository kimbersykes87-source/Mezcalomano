      <h2>Shipping Overview</h2>
      <p>We ship from the United States via our Pennsylvania-based 3PL (third-party logistics) partner. All orders are processed and shipped within 2-3 business days of order confirmation.</p>
      
      <h2>United States Shipping</h2>
      <p><strong>Free shipping</strong> is available on all orders shipped within the United States. Delivery typically takes 5-7 business days via standard shipping, though transit times may vary depending on your location.</p>
      
      <h2>International Shipping</h2>
      <p>We offer international shipping to select countries. International orders use <strong>flat-rate shipping</strong>. Please note that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>International shipping costs vary by destination</li>
        <li>Delivery times typically range from 10-21 business days</li>
        <li><strong>Duties and taxes are not included</strong> in the shipping price and are the responsibility of the recipient</li>
        <li>Customs processing may cause additional delays</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Shipping Charges</h2>
      <p>Shipping charges (for international orders) are calculated at checkout based on your delivery address. Free US shipping applies automatically to domestic orders.</p>
      
      <h2>Order Tracking</h2>
      <p>Once your order ships, you will receive a tracking number via email. You can use this number to track your package on the carrier's website.</p>
      
      <h2>Shipping Restrictions</h2>
      <p>Some destinations may have restrictions on alcohol-related products. Please check your local regulations before ordering. We are not responsible for packages that cannot be delivered due to local restrictions.</p>
